# java-katas

Code katas for Java programming language practicing.

This is my repository I use to study and practice the Java Programming Language concepts through Katas (short Dojo exercices) and also share this knowledge with the community.

Almost all examples are implemented with TDD, to help learn and master Java programming language concepts like language syntax, Java SE API, Java EE API, libraries, algorithms and related.
